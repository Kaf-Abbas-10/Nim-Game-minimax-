# Nim Game Simulation

This project implements the **Nim game** — a classic mathematical game of strategy — using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The game is designed for two players and demonstrates concepts such as game theory, recursion, and basic AI strategies.

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this notebook is to simulate the game of Nim, provide interactive gameplay, and optionally allow for strategic AI decision-making using the winning strategy from combinatorial game theory.

## 📁 File Overview

- **Nim_the_game.ipynb**: The main notebook containing:
  - Game rules and instructions
  - Code implementation for gameplay
  - Player vs. player and optional AI interaction
  - Visualization of game state after each move

## 🛠 Requirements

This is a lightweight, dependency-free project that only requires:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

Optional (for enhancements):
- `IPython.display` (used for clearer output formatting)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Nim_the_game.ipynb
